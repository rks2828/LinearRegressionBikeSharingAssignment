# Linear Regression Bike Sharing Assignment 
> The agenda of this Assignment is to analyze and find the factors affecting the demand for the shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

The assignment is to prepare a Model to predict the demand of the shared bikes and to find out the independent variables that is impacting the demand.

* [Conclusions](#conclusions)


## General Information
- The project is built using the Multiple Linear Regression Model by using the RFE algorithm to narrow down the independent variables that are impacting the deman.
- This Model will be used to predict the demand of the future bike sharing based on the new independent variables.
- The solution/model will help business increase the demand of the bike sharing by understanding the coefficients that are impacting the demand
- The csv data set day.csv is used to prepare and refine the model.


## Conclusions
- The temp independent variable has a highest coefficient on target variable followed by light_snowrain and year.
- The demand in Fall Season is highest in the overall year.
- The clear weather attracts more booking, booking is increasing year by year
- Booking seems to be more in holidays


## Technologies Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn, statsmodel
- python-3.12
